# Phase 2 (P1) Documentation Fixes - COMPLETED

**Branch:** `feat/issue-192-fix-documentation`  
**Worktree:** `/Users/ryan/src/azlin/worktrees/feat-issue-192-fix-documentation`  
**Date:** 2025-10-28

## Overview

All 18 P1 (High Priority) issues from Phase 2 of DOCUMENTATION_FIX_PLAN.md have been successfully fixed.

## Files Modified

- **README.md**: +781 lines (comprehensive improvements)
- **docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: +27 lines (targeted fixes)

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Enhanced `azlin list` Command (Task 2.1) ✅

**Location:** README.md, line ~448

**Changes:**
- Added `--all` option to show stopped/deallocated VMs
- Added `--tag KEY=VALUE` and `--tag KEY` filtering options
- Added "Output columns" explanation
- Added "Filtering" section with default behaviors
- Documented that default shows only running VMs

**Before:**
```bash
# List VMs in default resource group
azlin list

# List VMs in specific resource group
azlin list --resource-group my-custom-rg
```

**After:**
```bash
# List VMs in default resource group
azlin list

# Show ALL VMs (including stopped)
azlin list --all

# Filter by tag
azlin list --tag env=dev

# Filter by tag key only
azlin list --tag team

# Specific resource group
azlin list --resource-group my-custom-rg
```

---

### 2. Clarified `azlin stop` Command (Task 2.2) ✅

**Location:** README.md, line ~552

**Changes:**
- Explained default deallocate behavior
- Added `--no-deallocate` option
- Added "Cost Impact" section
- Clarified when to use each option

**Before:**
```bash
# Stop a VM to save costs
azlin stop my-vm
```

**After:**
```bash
# Stop VM (stops compute billing)
azlin stop my-vm

# By default, VM is DEALLOCATED (compute fully released)
# Storage charges still apply

# Stop without deallocating (keeps resources allocated)
azlin stop my-vm --no-deallocate

# Specific resource group
azlin stop my-vm --resource-group my-rg
```

**Cost Impact:**
- `azlin stop` (default deallocate) → Compute billing STOPS, storage continues
- `azlin stop --no-deallocate` → Full billing continues

---

### 3. Added VM Identifier Explanation (Task 2.3) ✅

**Location:** README.md, Connection section (before `azlin connect`)

**Changes:**
- Added new section "Understanding VM Identifiers"
- Explained 3 formats: VM Name, Session Name, IP Address
- Listed commands that accept VM identifiers
- Added usage tips

**Content:**
```markdown
### Understanding VM Identifiers

Many azlin commands accept a **VM identifier** in three formats:

1. **VM Name:** Full Azure VM name (e.g., `azlin-vm-12345`)
   - Requires: `--resource-group` or default config
   - Example: `azlin connect azlin-vm-12345 --rg my-rg`

2. **Session Name:** Custom label you assigned (e.g., `my-project`)
   - Automatically resolves to VM name
   - Example: `azlin connect my-project`

3. **IP Address:** Direct connection (e.g., `20.1.2.3`)
   - No resource group needed
   - Example: `azlin connect 20.1.2.3`

**Commands that accept VM identifiers:**
- `connect`, `update`, `os-update`, `stop`, `start`, `kill`, `destroy`

**Tip:** Use session names for easy access:
```bash
azlin session azlin-vm-12345 myproject
azlin connect myproject  # Much easier!
```
```

- Snapshot Naming format
- Schedule Management details
- Retention policy
- Use cases

---

### 5. Complete Environment Variables Documentation (Task 2.5) ✅

### 6. Added Deletion Commands Comparison Table (Task 2.6) ✅

**Location:** README.md, after `killall` command

**Changes:**
- Added comparison table for kill, destroy, killall
- Shows feature availability across commands
- Added "When to use" guidance

**Content:**
```markdown
### Deletion Commands Comparison

| Feature | `kill` | `destroy` | `killall` |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Delete single VM | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Delete multiple VMs | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Dry-run mode | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Delete resource group | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Confirmation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Force flag | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**When to use:**
- `kill` - Simple, quick VM deletion
- `destroy` - Advanced with dry-run and RG deletion
- `killall` - Bulk cleanup of multiple VMs
```

---

### 7. Added Natural Language Commands Comparison (Task 2.6, Part 2) ✅

**Location:** README.md, after AZDOIT documentation

**Changes:**
- Added comparison table for `do` vs `doit`

**Content:**
```markdown
### Natural Language Commands Comparison

| Feature | `do` | `doit` |
|---------|------|--------|
| Natural language parsing | ✓ | ✓ |
| Command execution | ✓ | ✓ |
| State persistence | ✗ | ✓ |
| Objective tracking | ✗ | ✓ |
| Audit logging | ✗ | ✓ |
| Multi-strategy (future) | ✗ | ✓ |
| Cost estimation (future) | ✗ | ✓ |

**When to use:**
- `do` - Quick, simple natural language commands
- `doit` - Complex objectives requiring state tracking
```

# Per-VM monthly estimates
azlin cost --by-vm --estimate
```

#### c. `status --vm` example
**Location:** VM Lifecycle section
```bash
# Show status for specific VM only
azlin status --vm my-vm
```

#### d. `storage delete --force` example
**Location:** Shared Storage section
```bash
# Delete storage (fails if VMs connected)
azlin storage delete myteam-shared

# Force delete even if VMs connected
azlin storage delete myteam-shared --force
```

---

### 9. Updated QUICK_REFERENCE.md Main Command (Task 3.2.1) ✅

**Location:** docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md, line ~45

**Change:**
- Updated main command description

```

---

### 10. Fixed QUICK_REFERENCE.md Pool Warning (Task 3.2.2) ✅

**Location:** docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md, line ~248

**Change:**

Estimated cost: ~$1.50/hour
```

**After:**
```
WARNING: Creating 11 VMs
Estimated cost: ~$1.10/hour
```

---

### 11. Added Performance Reference Section (Task 3.2.3) ✅

**Location:** docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md, end of file

**Changes:**
- Added complete Performance Reference section
- Operation timing table
- Optimization tips

**Content:**
```markdown
## Performance Reference

| Operation | Typical Time |
|-----------|--------------|
| `azlin list` | 2-3 seconds |
| `azlin status` | 3-5 seconds |
| `azlin cost` | 5-10 seconds |
| `azlin new` | 4-7 minutes |
| `azlin clone` | 10-15 minutes |
| `azlin update` | 2-5 minutes |
| `azlin sync` | 30s - 5 minutes |
| `azlin do` | +2s parsing overhead |

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use native commands for frequent operations
- `azlin do` adds 2-3 seconds parsing time
- Batch operations run in parallel
- Pool provisioning parallelized (4-7 min regardless of size)
```
