## Summary

Implemented three fault-tolerance pattern orchestrators using the orchestration infrastructure:

1. **N-Version Programming** (`n_version.py`) - 351 lines
2. **Multi-Agent Debate** (`debate.py`) - 400 lines
3. **Fallback Cascade** (`cascade.py`) - 392 lines

Total implementation: ~1,143 lines of production code

## Implementation Details

### 1. N-Version Programming (`n_version.py`)

**Purpose:** Generate N independent implementations in parallel, compare them, and select the best.

**Key Implementation Features:**

- Uses `run_parallel()` for N simultaneous implementations
- Diversity profiles: conservative, pragmatic, minimalist, innovative, performance-focused
- Selection criteria: correctness, security, simplicity, philosophy compliance, performance
- Reviewer agent compares all versions and selects best or synthesizes hybrid
- Comprehensive logging and session tracking

**Parameters:**

- `task_prompt` - Task specification
- `n` - Number of versions (default: 3)
- `model` - Claude model to use
- `working_dir` - Working directory
- `selection_criteria` - Criteria for selection (default: correctness, security, simplicity, philosophy, performance)
- `diversity_profiles` - Profiles for diversity (default: 5 predefined profiles)
- `timeout` - Timeout per version

**Returns:**

```python
{
    "versions": List[ProcessResult],
    "comparison": ProcessResult,
    "selected": str,  # "version_N" or "hybrid"
    "rationale": str,
    "session_id": str,
    "success": bool,
}
```

**Workflow Steps:**

1. Prepare common context (clear specification)
2. Generate N implementations in parallel with diversity profiles
3. Collect and compare implementations
4. Review and evaluate using reviewer agent
5. Extract selection from reviewer output

**Error Handling:**

- If all implementations fail: return failure with explanation
- If reviewer fails: fallback to first successful version
- If selection parsing fails: select first successful version

### 2. Multi-Agent Debate (`debate.py`)

**Purpose:** Conduct structured debate with multiple perspectives to reach consensus.

**Key Implementation Features:**

- Perspective profiles: security, performance, simplicity, maintainability, user_experience
- Structured rounds: initial positions → challenge/respond → synthesis
- Uses `run_parallel()` within each round
- Facilitator synthesis with confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Complete debate transcript tracking

**Parameters:**

- `decision_question` - Question to debate
- `perspectives` - List of perspectives (default: security, performance, simplicity)
- `rounds` - Number of rounds (default: 3)
- `model` - Claude model to use
- `working_dir` - Working directory
- `timeout` - Timeout per perspective

**Returns:**

```python
{
    "rounds": List[dict],
    "positions": Dict[str, List[str]],
    "synthesis": ProcessResult,
    "confidence": str,  # "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW"
    "session_id": str,
    "success": bool,
}
```

**Workflow Steps:**

1. Initialize perspectives with profiles
2. Round 1: Each perspective forms initial position (parallel)
3. Rounds 2-N: Challenge and respond (parallel per round)
4. Facilitator synthesis
5. Determine confidence level

**Error Handling:**

- If all perspectives fail in Round 1: return failure
- Successful rounds tracked individually
- Confidence adjusted based on participation rate
- Synthesis failure results in LOW confidence

---

### 3. Fallback Cascade (`cascade.py`)

**Purpose:** Graceful degradation through cascading fallback strategies.

**Key Implementation Features:**

- Three levels: primary → secondary → tertiary
- Timeout strategies: aggressive (5s/2s/1s), balanced (30s/10s/5s), patient (120s/30s/10s)
- Fallback types: quality, service, freshness, completeness, accuracy
- Notification levels: silent, warning, explicit
- Custom cascade support via `create_custom_cascade()`

**Parameters:**

- `task_prompt` - Task to execute
- `fallback_strategy` - Type of degradation (default: "quality")
- `timeout_strategy` - Timeout levels (default: "balanced")
- `models` - Optional models for each level
- `working_dir` - Working directory
- `notification_level` - How to notify (default: "warning")
- `custom_timeouts` - Override timeout strategy
- `custom_constraints` - Override fallback templates

**Returns:**

```python
{
    "result": ProcessResult,
    "cascade_level": str,  # "primary", "secondary", "tertiary", or "failed"
    "degradation": str,
    "attempts": List[ProcessResult],
    "session_id": str,
    "success": bool,
}
```

**Workflow Steps:**

1. Define cascade levels with timeouts and constraints
2. Attempt primary level
3. If fails, attempt secondary level
4. If fails, attempt tertiary level
5. Report degradation

**Error Handling:**

- Tertiary level designed to never fail
- Each level has progressively shorter timeout
- Degradation clearly documented
- Notification based on level setting

**Additional Function: `create_custom_cascade()`**

- Allows fully custom cascade levels
- Takes list of level definitions with name, timeout, constraint, model
- Same return structure as `run_cascade()`

## Architecture Integration

All patterns are built on the orchestration infrastructure:

```
orchestration/
├── claude_process.py       # Subprocess wrapper
├── execution.py            # Parallel/sequential/fallback helpers
├── session.py              # Session management
└── patterns/
    ├── n_version.py        # N-Version orchestrator
    ├── debate.py           # Debate orchestrator
    ├── cascade.py          # Cascade orchestrator
    └── __init__.py         # Exports
```

**Infrastructure Usage:**

- `ClaudeProcess` - All patterns use this for subprocess management
- `ProcessResult` - Standardized result structure
- `OrchestratorSession` - Session tracking and logging
- `run_parallel()` - Used by N-Version and Debate for parallel execution
- `run_with_fallback()` - Referenced by Cascade documentation

---

## Testing Strategy

Each pattern is testable with simple examples:

### N-Version Test:

```python
result = run_n_version(
    task_prompt="Implement password hashing function",
    n=3,
    selection_criteria=["security", "best_practices"]
)
assert result['success']
assert result['selected'] in ['version_1', 'version_2', 'version_3', 'hybrid']
assert len(result['versions']) == 3
```

### Debate Test:

```python
result = run_debate(
    decision_question="Should we use PostgreSQL or Redis?",
    perspectives=["security", "performance", "simplicity"],
    rounds=3
)
assert result['success']
assert result['confidence'] in ['HIGH', 'MEDIUM', 'LOW']
assert len(result['rounds']) == 3
```

### Cascade Test:

```python
result = run_cascade(
    task_prompt="Generate API documentation",
    timeout_strategy="balanced"
)
assert result['success']
assert result['cascade_level'] in ['primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary']
assert len(result['attempts']) >= 1
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Why Three Separate Files?

Each pattern is complex enough (~350-400 lines) to warrant its own module. This:

- Keeps concerns separated
- Makes patterns easier to understand
- Allows independent evolution
- Follows single responsibility principle

### 2. Why Parallel by Default?

N-Version and Debate use parallel execution because:

- Implementations/perspectives are independent
- Parallelism significantly reduces wall-clock time
- No shared state or dependencies between processes
- Aligns with Amplihack's parallel execution philosophy

### 3. Why Sequential for Cascade?

Cascade uses sequential execution because:

- Later levels depend on earlier levels failing
- Hard dependency: try next only if current fails
- Cannot parallelize fallback logic
- Graceful degradation requires ordered attempts

### 4. Why Structured Returns?

All patterns return dicts with standardized keys:

- Consistent interface across patterns
- Easy to extract specific information
- Supports both programmatic and human inspection
- Enables result composition and chaining

### 5. Why Session Logging?

Every pattern creates a session with logs because:

- Traceability of all operations
- Debugging support for failures
- Historical record of decisions
- Audit trail for critical operations

## Extension Points

### Adding New N-Version Profiles:

```python
custom_profiles = [
    {
        "name": "security_focused",
        "traits": "Prioritize security over all else",
    },
    # ... more profiles
]
run_n_version(task, diversity_profiles=custom_profiles)
```

### Adding New Debate Perspectives:

```python
# Patterns auto-create profiles for unknown perspectives
run_debate(question, perspectives=["security", "legal", "ethical"])
```

### Adding New Cascade Strategies:

```python
custom_constraints = {
    "primary": "with full GPU acceleration",
    "secondary": "with CPU-only processing",
    "tertiary": "with minimal computation",
}
run_cascade(task, custom_constraints=custom_constraints)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### N-Version Programming:

- **Time:** Max(N implementations) + reviewer time
- **Parallelization:** N implementations run simultaneously
- **Typical duration:** 5-15 minutes for N=3 with complex tasks
- **Cost:** N × single implementation cost + reviewer cost

### Multi-Agent Debate:

- **Time:** rounds × Max(perspective analysis)
- **Parallelization:** All perspectives per round run simultaneously
- **Typical duration:** 5-10 minutes for 3 rounds, 3-4 perspectives
- **Cost:** rounds × perspectives × single analysis cost

### Fallback Cascade:

- **Time:** Sum of all attempted levels up to success
- **Parallelization:** None (sequential by design)
- **Typical duration:** Varies based on which level succeeds
  - Primary success: timeout_primary
  - Secondary success: timeout_primary + timeout_secondary
  - Tertiary success: sum of all timeouts
- **Cost:** Cost of levels attempted (1-3 levels)
