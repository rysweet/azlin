# N-Version Programming Validator Agent

## Purpose

Implements N-version programming fault-tolerance pattern using agent orchestration. Generates multiple independent implementations and selects the best through comparison and voting.

## When to Use

Use this agent for **critical tasks** where correctness is paramount:

- Security-sensitive code (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- Core algorithms (payment calculations, data transformations)
- Mission-critical features (data backup, recovery procedures)

## Cost-Benefit

- **Cost:** 3-4x execution time (N parallel implementations)
- **Benefit:** 30-65% error reduction (from research PR #946)
- **ROI Positive when:** Task criticality > 3x cost multiplier

## How It Works

### Three-Phase Process

**Phase 1: Independent Generation (Parallel)**

```
Task: Implement password hashing function

Agent 1 → Implementation A (bcrypt approach)
Agent 2 → Implementation B (argon2 approach)
Agent 3 → Implementation C (PBKDF2 approach)
```

All agents work independently with no context sharing.

**Phase 2: Comparison & Analysis**

```
Reviewer Agent compares all 3 implementations:
- Correctness (security best practices)
- Edge case handling
- Performance characteristics
- Code quality
```

**Phase 3: Selection or Synthesis**

```
Options:
1. Select single best implementation
2. Synthesize hybrid from best parts
3. Identify consensus approach
```

## Agent Orchestration

### Implementation Pattern

```markdown
@.claude/agents/amplihack/specialized/n-version-validator.md

Task: [Your critical task]
Target Agents: 3 (or specify N)
Selection Criteria: [Correctness, Security, Performance, etc.]
```

Agent automatically:

1. Spawns N independent builder agents in parallel
2. Collects all implementations
3. Invokes reviewer for comparison
4. Presents analysis and recommendation
5. Implements chosen approach

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Authentication Function

```
User: "Implement JWT token validation - this is critical for security"

N-Version Agent:
1. Spawns 3 builder agents with identical prompt
2. Agent A: Uses PyJWT library with standard validation
3. Agent B: Manual JWT decode with explicit checks
4. Agent C: Hybrid approach with additional security layers

Reviewer Analysis:
- Agent A: Industry standard, well-tested
- Agent B: More control, but reinventing wheel
- Agent C: Over-engineered for this use case

Recommendation: Agent A (PyJWT with standard validation)
Confidence: HIGH - Aligns with industry best practices
```

### Example 2: Data Encryption

```
User: "Encrypt sensitive user data before storing"

N-Version Agent generates 3 approaches:
1. Fernet (symmetric) - Simple, standard library
2. AES-256-GCM - More control, explicit params
3. Hybrid RSA + AES - Asymmetric + symmetric

Analysis identifies:
- Approach 1: Best for this use case (at-rest encryption)
- Approach 2: Unnecessarily complex
- Approach 3: Overkill (no key exchange needed)

Selected: Fernet with proper key management
```

## Configuration Options

### Number of Versions (N)

```markdown
Recommended by criticality:

HIGH Criticality (security, payments): N = 4-6
MEDIUM Criticality (core features): N = 3
LOW Criticality (standard features): N = 2 (just comparison)
```

### Selection Criteria

Customize comparison criteria:

- **Correctness**: Does it work? Handle edge cases?
- **Security**: Follow best practices? Vulnerabilities?
- **Performance**: Efficiency appropriate for use case?
- **Maintainability**: Clean code? Well-documented?
- **Philosophy**: Ruthless simplicity? Zero-BS?

### Agent Diversity

Specify agent diversity:

```markdown
Agent Profiles:

1. Security-Focused Builder
2. Performance-Focused Builder
3. Simplicity-Focused Builder
```

Diversity increases solution space coverage.

## Success Metrics

From research (PR #946):

- **Error Reduction**: 30-65% for critical tasks
- **Best Practices Alignment**: 90%+ when N ≥ 3
- **Defect Detection**: 80%+ of security issues caught

## Limitations

**Not Appropriate For:**

- Simple, well-understood tasks
- Time-critical implementations
- Non-critical utility functions
- Trivial bug fixes

**Cost Too High:**

- 4-6x multiplier for simple CRUD
- Documentation changes
- UI adjustments

## Integration with Workflow

**DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md Integration:**

**Step 4 (Design):** Use for critical architecture decisions
**Step 5 (Implementation):** Use for security-critical code
**Step 11 (Review):** Automatic N-version validation

## Philosophy Alignment

✅ **Fault Tolerance**: Mathematical guarantee (3f+1 bound)
✅ **Explicit Trade-offs**: Clear cost-benefit analysis
✅ **Selective Application**: Only for critical tasks
✅ **Measurable Impact**: Quantified error reduction

## Usage

This pattern is implemented as a workflow. Use the `/amplihack:n-version` command:

```bash
/amplihack:n-version "Implement password hashing function"
```

The workflow file `.claude/workflow/N_VERSION_WORKFLOW.md` can be customized to adjust:

- Number of versions (N)
- Selection criteria
- Timeout settings
- Agent diversity profiles

## Example Output

```
N-Version Programming: Task "Implement password hashing"
====================================================

Generating 3 independent implementations...
✓ Implementation A complete (12s)
✓ Implementation B complete (15s)
✓ Implementation C complete (14s)

Comparison Analysis
==================
Implementation A: bcrypt with salt rounds=12
  + Industry standard
  + Well-tested library
  + Handles edge cases
  - Slightly slower

Implementation B: argon2id
  + Modern algorithm
  + OWASP recommended
  + Memory-hard
  - Less ecosystem support

Implementation C: PBKDF2
  + Built-in library
  + Simple
  - Older algorithm
  - Fewer iterations needed

Recommendation
=============
Selected: Implementation B (argon2id)

Rationale:
- Best security properties (memory-hard)
- OWASP current recommendation
- Negligible ecosystem concern for this use case

Confidence: HIGH
Consensus: 2/3 reviewers prefer B
```

## Quick Start

1. Reference this agent for critical tasks
2. Specify N (number of versions)
3. Define selection criteria
4. Agent handles orchestration automatically
5. Review analysis and selected implementation
