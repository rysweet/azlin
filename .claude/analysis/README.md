# Analysis Reports

This directory contains active analysis reports for the azlin project.

## Structure

- `/archive/` - Historical analysis reports (archived by date)
- Root - Current/active analysis reports only

## Guidelines

### Active Reports
Keep only current, actionable analysis reports in the root directory:
- Security audits in progress
- Performance analysis for ongoing work
- Code quality reviews for active features

### Archiving
When reports are resolved or no longer active:
1. Move to `/archive/YYYY-MM/`
2. Update `/archive/INDEX.md`
3. Remove references from active docs

### File Naming
- `SECURITY-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` - Security analysis
- `PERF-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` - Performance analysis
- `CODE-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` - Code quality review

## Automation

Analysis reports are automatically generated by:
- Security hooks (XPIA defense)
- Reflection system
- Context preservation checks

See `.gitignore` for exclusion patterns (generated artifacts are ignored).
