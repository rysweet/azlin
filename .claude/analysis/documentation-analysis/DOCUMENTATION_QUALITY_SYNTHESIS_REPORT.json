EXCELLENT: Azure CLI tool (azlin) - comprehensive user guide, architecture, agent guide\n3. POOR: Amplihack framework itself - no overview doc, incomplete hook/agent documentation\n\nThe paradox: The tools (.claude/tools/amplihack/) and framework infrastructure are extensively built but under-documented, while the philosophical foundations that guide their use are exceptionally well-documented.\n\nThis suggests the project has:\n- Strong philosophical clarity (knows WHY and HOW to build)\n- Strong implementation (tools exist and work based on evidence of patterns used)\n- Weak meta-documentation (doesn't explain WHAT amplihack is as a whole)\n\nThe documentation quality for what IS documented is excellent (4/5 stars), but completeness is moderate (3/5 stars) due to the amplihack framework gap.",
