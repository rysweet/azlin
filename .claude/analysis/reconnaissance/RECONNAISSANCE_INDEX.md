1. Read `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md` from top to bottom
2. Focus on sections:
   - Directory Structure
   - Module Inventory
   - Architecture Patterns
   - Dependency Graph
   - Key Execution Flows
3. Review Recommendations section

### For Integration with Tools
1. Parse `azlin_structure_report.json`
2. Extract relevant sections for your tool
3. Use module responsibility matrix for ownership tracking
4. Track dependency graph for impact analysis

### For Developer Onboarding
1. Give new developers `RECONNAISSANCE_SUMMARY.txt`
2. Have them read "TIER" sections to understand layering
3. Provide `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md` for deep dives
4. Use module inventory as reference while exploring code

## Navigation Guide

### If You Want to Understand...

**The overall architecture:**
→ Read RECONNAISSANCE_SUMMARY.txt, then PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md sections:
   - Directory Structure
   - Architecture Patterns

**How modules depend on each other:**
→ Review azlin_structure_report.json → dependency_graph section
→ Or PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md → Dependency Graph section

**Where to add new features:**
→ See PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md → Recommendations
→ Check azlin_structure_report.json → entry_points → command_categories

**Security architecture:**
→ PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md → Security Architecture
→ azlin_structure_report.json → architecture_patterns → security_layers

**What modules need refactoring:**
→ RECONNAISSANCE_SUMMARY.txt → WEAKNESSES
→ PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md → Module Boundary Analysis

**Test coverage and strategy:**
→ PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md → Test Structure
→ azlin_structure_report.json → test_structure
