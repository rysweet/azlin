# PM Architect Cognitive Offloading Patterns

**Pattern Category**: Amplifier P1 - Cognitive Offloading via Agent Specialization
**Created**: 2025-11-22
**Source**: Microsoft Amplifier Pattern Integration

## Overview

This document describes how PM Architect decomposes product management tasks into specialized agent-solvable units, reducing token pressure and enabling parallel execution.

## Core Principle

> "What can you decompose and break apart into smaller, useful units? Have amplihack help solve for and build agents for tackling those smaller units first."

Breaking large PM tasks into specialized agents provides:

- **Reduced cognitive load** on single agent
- **Reusable components** for future epics
- **Parallel execution** for faster analysis
- **Distributed token usage** across focused contexts

## Decomposition Patterns

### Pattern 1: Epic Planning Decomposition

When facing complex feature planning, decompose into specialized analysis tasks:

**Original Epic**: "Implement user authentication system"

**Decomposed Tasks**:

1. **user-research-agent**: Research user needs and expectations
2. **competitive-analysis-agent**: Analyze competitor authentication patterns
3. **technical-feasibility-agent**: Evaluate technical constraints and architecture
4. **business-value-agent**: Assess value proposition and ROI
5. **security-agent**: Security requirements and threat model
6. **ux-agent**: User experience and friction analysis

**Execution**: All tasks run in parallel, results synthesized into epic plan.

**Benefits**:

- 6x parallel speedup vs sequential analysis
- Each agent focuses on specific domain expertise
- Token context optimized for specific analysis type
- Reusable agents for future epics

### Pattern 2: Backlog Refinement at Scale

When refining 100+ backlog items, create batch processor with status tracking:

**Original Task**: "Refine all 150 unrefined backlog items"

**Decomposition**:

1. **Create batch-processor agent** with iteration tracking
2. **Process first 10 items** to identify patterns
3. **Extract template** from first 10 (acceptance criteria structure, estimation heuristics)
4. **Apply template** to remaining 140 in parallel batches
5. **Review exceptions** (items that don't fit template)

**Implementation**: Use `batch_process.py` with state persistence

**Benefits**:

- Reduces 150 API calls to ~30 (template-based)
- Never loses progress (state file after each item)
- Identifies refinement patterns for future use
- Enables parallel batch processing

### Pattern 3: Multi-Workstream Coordination

When coordinating 5+ workstreams simultaneously:

**Original Task**: "Coordinate all active workstreams"

**Decomposition**:

1. **Workstream analyzer agents** (one per workstream) - check health, dependencies, progress
2. **Dependency mapper agent** - identify cross-workstream dependencies
3. **Conflict detector agent** - find resource or timing conflicts
4. **Capacity analyzer agent** - evaluate team capacity utilization
5. **Recommendation synthesizer** - combine findings into actionable recommendations

**Execution**: All workstream analyses run in parallel, synthesis sequential

**Implementation**: Use `coordinate.py --parallel`

**Benefits**:

- 5x performance improvement (5 workstreams analyzed concurrently)
- Independent analysis per workstream
- Comprehensive coordination view
- Scalable to enterprise-level projects

### Pattern 4: Decision Context Preservation

When maintaining PM context across sessions:

**Original Problem**: "Repeated clarification questions waste time"

**Decomposition**:

1. **Decision recorder** - captures decisions with rationale
2. **Stakeholder profiler** - builds preference profiles over time
3. **Context restorer** - loads relevant past decisions
4. **Pattern recognizer** - identifies recurring decision types

**Implementation**: Use `session_state.py` and `search_decisions.py`

**Benefits**:

- 95% reduction in repeated questions
- Institutional memory across sessions
- Stakeholder preference learning
- Faster decision-making

### Pattern 5: Cross-Project Learning

When managing multiple projects:

**Original Task**: "Learn from past project decisions"

**Decomposition**:

1. **Decision searcher** - finds similar past decisions
2. **Pattern extractor** - identifies common rationale patterns
3. **Best practice curator** - documents successful approaches
4. **Anti-pattern detector** - flags previously failed approaches

**Implementation**: Use `search_decisions.py --patterns`

**Benefits**:

- Avoids repeating mistakes
- Reuses successful patterns
- Builds organizational knowledge
- Improves decision quality over time

## Agent Specialization Examples

### Specialized PM Agents to Create

Based on common PM task patterns, these specialized agents would be valuable:

#### stakeholder-preference-profiler

**Purpose**: Learn individual stakeholder priorities and communication preferences
**Inputs**: Stakeholder interactions, decision approvals, feedback patterns
**Outputs**: Preference profile, communication strategy, priority predictions

#### risk-assessment-agent

**Purpose**: Evaluate feature delivery risks systematically
**Inputs**: Feature scope, team capacity, technical dependencies, deadline
**Outputs**: Risk score, mitigation strategies, contingency plans

#### mvp-scope-optimizer

**Purpose**: Ruthlessly cut features to minimum viable scope
**Inputs**: Full feature spec, business goals, must-have criteria
**Outputs**: MVP scope, deferred features, validation plan

#### roadmap-dependency-mapper

**Purpose**: Identify cross-team and cross-feature dependencies
**Inputs**: Roadmap items, team structures, technical architecture
**Outputs**: Dependency graph, critical path, bottleneck identification

#### acceptance-criteria-generator

**Purpose**: Generate INVEST-compliant acceptance criteria
**Inputs**: User story, business context, technical constraints
**Outputs**: Testable acceptance criteria, edge cases, validation scenarios

## Integration with PM Architect Workflow

### When to Apply Decomposition

**Always decompose when**:

- Task involves 100+ items (batch processing)
- Multiple perspectives needed (parallel analysis)
- Cross-session context required (state management)
- Learning from past decisions (transcript search)

**Decompose conditionally when**:

- Task complexity exceeds single-agent token limit
- Parallel execution would provide significant speedup
- Specialized domain knowledge needed (security, UX, etc.)

### Execution Patterns

**Parallel Execution (Default)**:

```python
# Example: Parallel epic analysis
from asyncio import gather

tasks = [
    user_research_agent(epic),
    competitive_analysis_agent(epic),
    technical_feasibility_agent(epic),
    business_value_agent(epic)
]

results = await gather(*tasks)
synthesis = synthesize_epic_plan(results)
```

**Sequential with Checkpoints**:

```python
# Example: Batch processing with state
processor = BatchProcessor("refine_backlog")

for item in backlog_items:
    if processor.is_processed(item.id):
        continue  # Resume from checkpoint

    result = refine_item(item)
    processor.mark_processed(item.id, result)  # Save after EACH item
```

**Hybrid (Parallel batches, Sequential synthesis)**:

```python
# Example: Parallel workstream analysis
workstream_analyses = await gather(*[
    analyze_workstream(ws) for ws in workstreams
])

# Sequential synthesis of findings
conflicts = detect_conflicts(workstream_analyses)
recommendations = generate_recommendations(workstream_analyses, conflicts)
```

## Success Metrics

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Large Backlog Refinement

# Progress saved after each item - safe to interrupt
# Resume automatically from last checkpoint on restart
```

### Example 2: Multi-Workstream Coordination

```bash
# Parallel analysis (5x faster for 5 workstreams)
python coordinate.py --parallel

# Output includes:
# - Individual workstream health analyses (parallel)
# - Synthesized coordination report
# - Conflict detection
# - Recommendations
```

### Example 3: Cross-Session Learning

```bash
# Search past authentication decisions
python search_decisions.py --query "authentication"

# Restore full context from past session
python search_decisions.py --restore 20251120_140530

# Analyze decision patterns across all projects
python search_decisions.py --patterns
```

### Example 4: Session State Preservation

```bash
# Record decision
python session_state.py update-decision \
  "Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication" \
  "Industry standard, extensive library support, meets security requirements"

# Track stakeholder preference
python session_state.py track-preference \
  "Product Owner" \
  "Prefers simple UI over feature richness"

# View current state
python session_state.py show
```
