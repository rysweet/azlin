## Key Features

### CI Pipeline (ci.yml)

**Fast Feedback:**
- Parallel job execution (pre-commit, type-check, tests run simultaneously)
- Intelligent caching (uv, pytest, pre-commit)
- Concurrency controls cancel outdated runs
- Clear failure messages with emojis

**Testing:**
- Full pytest suite on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Unit tests with coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Integration tests on main branch only
- Test results uploaded as artifacts (30-day retention)

**Code Quality:**
- Pre-commit hooks validation (ruff, formatting, file hygiene)
- Strict type checking with Pyright
- Coverage reports to Codecov
- JUnit XML test reports

**Performance:**
- Pre-commit: ~2-5 minutes
- Type checking: ~2-3 minutes
- Tests: ~5-10 minutes per Python version
- Total pipeline: ~10-15 minutes

### Security Pipeline (security.yml)

**Comprehensive Scanning:**
- **GitGuardian** - Blocks PRs if secrets detected
- **Bandit** - Python security issues
- **Safety** - Vulnerable dependencies
- **CodeQL** - Advanced semantic analysis
- **Trivy** - Container/dependency vulnerabilities
- **OSSF Scorecard** - Project security best practices

**Automated:**
- Runs on every PR and push to main
- Daily scheduled scans at 2 AM UTC
- Manual trigger available
- 90-day artifact retention for security reports

### Dependency Management (dependabot.yml)

**Automated Updates:**
- Python packages (grouped: pytest, dev-tools, azure)
- GitHub Actions versions
- Pre-commit hooks
- Weekly updates on Monday mornings

## Setup Required

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions

In your repository settings:
- Go to Settings → Actions → General
- Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
- Save

### 2. Configure Secrets (Optional but Recommended)

Add these secrets in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

```bash
CODECOV_TOKEN    # Get from https://codecov.io (free for open source)
GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY  # Get from https://gitguardian.com (free tier available)
```

**Without these secrets:**
- CI will still work (coverage upload will be skipped)
- Security scans will work but GitGuardian may be limited

### 3. Enable Dependabot

In Settings → Code security and analysis:
- Enable "Dependabot alerts"
- Enable "Dependabot security updates"
- Enable "Dependabot version updates"

### 4. Add Status Badges

Add to your README.md:

```markdown
## Status

![CI](https://github.com/rysweet/azlin/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
![Security](https://github.com/rysweet/azlin/workflows/Security%20Scanning/badge.svg)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/rysweet/azlin/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rysweet/azlin)
```

## Testing the Workflows

### Local Testing

Before pushing, test workflows locally:

```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"

# Run pre-commit checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run type checking
pyright src/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit --cov=src/azlin --cov-report=term-missing

# Check coverage threshold
pytest tests/unit --cov=src/azlin --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=80
```

### First Run

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b ci/add-github-actions
   ```

2. Commit the workflow files:
   ```bash
   git add .github/
   git commit -m "ci: Add comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows"
   ```

3. Push and create PR:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin ci/add-github-actions
   gh pr create --title "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD" --body "Implements comprehensive CI/CD with testing, security scanning, and automated dependency updates"
   ```

4. Watch the workflows run on the PR
5. Verify all checks pass
6. Merge to main

## Monitoring

### View Workflow Runs

- Go to Actions tab in GitHub
- Click on a workflow to see details
- Download artifacts for test results and security reports

### Failed Runs

Each job includes clear error messages:
- ✅ Success - Check passed
- ❌ Failure - Check failed with explanation
- ⚠️ Warning - Non-critical issue detected

### Coverage Reports

After PR checks complete:
- View coverage in Codecov dashboard
- Download HTML coverage report from artifacts
- Check which lines need test coverage

## Customization

### Adjust Coverage Threshold

Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
THRESHOLD=80  # Change to desired percentage (e.g., 85, 90)
```

### Change Python Versions

Edit the matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
matrix:
  python-version: ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]  # Add/remove versions
```

### Skip Integration Tests on PRs

Integration tests only run on main by default. To enable on PRs:

```yaml
if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

### Adjust Security Scan Schedule

Edit `.github/workflows/security.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Change time/frequency
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Fail Fast** - Quick checks run first (pre-commit, type-check)
2. **Parallel Execution** - Independent jobs run simultaneously
3. **Smart Caching** - Dependencies cached for speed
4. **Clear Feedback** - Descriptive job names and error messages
5. **Resource Efficient** - Concurrency controls prevent waste
6. **Security First** - Multiple security layers
7. **Automated Updates** - Dependabot keeps everything current
8. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, security coverage

## Troubleshooting

### "Coverage below 80%" Error

```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest tests/unit --cov=src/azlin --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # View uncovered lines

# Add tests for uncovered code
# Then verify locally:
pytest tests/unit --cov=src/azlin --cov-fail-under=80
```

### Pre-commit Hook Failures

```bash
# Update hooks
pre-commit autoupdate

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run ruff --all-files

# Clear cache if needed
pre-commit clean
```

### Type Checking Failures

```bash
# Run Pyright locally
pyright src/

# Fix type issues or add type: ignore comments for false positives
```

### Security Scan False Positives

Edit `.github/workflows/security.yml` to adjust severity levels or add exclusions.

## Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- Review Dependabot PRs
- Update security scan configurations if needed
- Check for new GitHub Actions versions

### Quarterly Tasks
- Review and update coverage threshold
- Audit security scan results
- Update workflow documentation

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the workflow README: `.github/workflows/README.md`
2. View GitHub Actions logs in the Actions tab
3. Review this setup guide
4. Consult [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Success Criteria

All workflows are complete when:
- ✅ All YAML files are valid
- ✅ CI pipeline passes on PRs
- ✅ Security scans run without errors
- ✅ Coverage reporting works
- ✅ Dependabot creates update PRs
- ✅ Status badges show in README
