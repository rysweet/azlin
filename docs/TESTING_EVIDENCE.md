# Storage Delete Bug Fix - Testing Evidence

## Bug Report
**Issue**: `azlin storage delete` command fails with error: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`

**Root Cause**: The `delete_storage` command was trying to access a return value from `StorageManager.delete_storage()`, which returns `None`, not a dictionary.

## Fix Applied
1. Removed invalid return value check that caused TypeError
2. Added proper config cleanup to remove storage account and VM mappings from config
3. Improved error handling in delete command

## Test Results
