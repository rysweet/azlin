## Key Design Principles

### Security First
- File permissions 0600 (owner only)
- No credential logging
- Atomic file operations
- Path validation
- Input sanitization

### Backward Compatible
- All changes optional (SP disabled by default)
- New config fields optional (existing configs still load)
- No changes to existing CLI commands
- No changes to existing auth flow
- New CLI commands in separate group

### Minimal Changes
- Create 1 new file (~200 lines)
- Modify 3 existing files (~150 lines total)
- Reuse existing patterns
- No new dependencies
- ~350 lines of implementation code total

### Testable Design
- Dependency injection support
- Mockable components
- Isolated functionality
- Clear interfaces
- Easy to test in isolation

## Questions to Ask While Reading

### Understanding Phase
1. How does current auth work without storing credentials?
2. Why is Azure CLI delegation better than SDK?
3. What's the priority chain and why does it matter?
4. How do config files work with atomic operations?
5. Why are file permissions (0600) important?

### Design Phase
1. Where should SP code live (new file vs. existing)?
2. How do we integrate SP with existing priority chain?
3. What new CLI commands are needed?
4. How do we maintain backward compatibility?
5. What security concerns do we need to address?

### Implementation Phase
1. What's the minimal code to implement?
2. How do we test SP authentication?
3. How do we test backward compatibility?
4. What could go wrong and how do we prevent it?
5. How do we verify security was not compromised?
