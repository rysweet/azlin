## 🚦 Recommendation

### Option 1: Complete Remaining Work (Recommended)
Continue with Step 5-15 of workflow to finish the NFS feature completely. Estimated 8-12 additional hours.

**Pros**: Full feature delivery, production-ready, documented
**Cons**: Requires significant additional time

### Option 2: Merge Current Progress
Merge current implementation as "experimental" feature, document known issues, complete later.

**Pros**: Progress not lost, value delivered incrementally  
**Cons**: Incomplete feature, may confuse users

### Option 3: Continue in Next Session
Pause here, document state thoroughly (this document), continue in next development session.

**Pros**: Natural stopping point, clear handoff  
**Cons**: Context switching cost
