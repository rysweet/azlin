## Shared Disk Research: Multi-VM Home Directories

### Research Question
Can multiple Linux VMs share a home directory via network-mounted shared disk? Is it easy to implement?

### Answer: YES - Multiple Solutions Available

### Option 1: Azure Files NFS (Recommended for azlin)

**Feasibility**: ✅ High  
**Ease of Implementation**: ✅ Easy  
**Cost**: $ Moderate

#### How It Works
1. Create Azure Storage Account (Premium or Standard tier)
2. Enable NFS v4.1 protocol support
3. Create file share within storage account
4. Mount on multiple VMs using standard NFS mount

#### Implementation Steps
```bash
# On each VM:
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
sudo mount -t nfs -o sec=sys \
  <storage-account>.file.core.windows.net:/<share-name> \
  /home/azureuser

# Persist in /etc/fstab:
<storage-account>.file.core.windows.net:/<share-name> /home/azureuser nfs defaults 0 0
```

#### Characteristics
- **Performance**: Good for most workloads (thousands of IOPS)
- **Protocols**: NFSv4.1 (Linux native)
- **Security**: VNet/Private Endpoint required
- **Scalability**: Up to 100 TiB per share
- **Concurrent Access**: Full read/write from all VMs
- **Latency**: Low (single-digit ms within region)

#### Pros
- ✅ Native Azure service, no additional infrastructure
- ✅ Simple to implement (standard NFS mount)
- ✅ Automatic backups available
- ✅ Integrated with Azure RBAC
- ✅ Cost-effective for moderate use

#### Cons
- ❌ Requires Premium or Standard storage account
- ❌ Must use VNet (no public access for NFS)
- ❌ Network dependency (VM performance affected by network)

### Option 2: Azure NetApp Files (High Performance)

**Feasibility**: ✅ High  
**Ease of Implementation**: ⚠️ Moderate  
**Cost**: $$$ Higher

#### Characteristics
- **Performance**: Exceptional (ultra-low latency, high throughput)
- **Protocols**: NFSv3, NFSv4.1, dual-protocol (SMB+NFS)
- **Features**: Snapshots, cross-region replication, cloning
- **Use Cases**: High-performance workloads (SAP HANA, HPC)

#### Pros
- ✅ Enterprise-grade performance
- ✅ Advanced features (snapshots, replication)
- ✅ Supports dual-protocol (Linux + Windows)
- ✅ NetApp ONTAP features

#### Cons
- ❌ More expensive than Azure Files
- ❌ Additional setup complexity
- ❌ Minimum capacity commitments
- ❌ Overkill for typical dev environments

### Option 3: Self-Managed NFS Server

**Feasibility**: ✅ Medium  
**Ease of Implementation**: ⚠️ Complex  
**Cost**: $$ Variable

#### How It Works
1. Provision dedicated VM as NFS server
2. Attach managed disks for storage
3. Configure NFS exports
4. Mount on client VMs

#### Pros
- ✅ Full control over configuration
- ✅ Can optimize for specific workloads
- ✅ No Azure Files service costs

#### Cons
- ❌ Manual management and maintenance
- ❌ Single point of failure (need HA setup)
- ❌ Security configuration complexity
- ❌ Backup/disaster recovery responsibility

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Azure Files NFS | Azure NetApp Files | Self-Managed NFS |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Setup Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Easy | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ⭐⭐ Complex |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐ Variable |
| Cost | $$ Moderate | $$$ High | $$ Variable |
| Management | Fully managed | Fully managed | Manual |
| Scalability | High | Very High | Manual |
| HA/DR | Built-in | Built-in | Manual |
| Integration | Native Azure | Native Azure | Custom |

### Recommendation for azlin

**Use Azure Files NFS** for the following reasons:

1. **Simple Integration**: Standard NFS mount, no custom infrastructure
2. **Cost-Effective**: Reasonable pricing for dev environments
3. **Managed Service**: No operational overhead
4. **Native Azure**: Integrates with existing azlin architecture
5. **Good Performance**: Sufficient for development workloads
6. **Easy Implementation**: Can be added to cloud-init scripts

### Caveats and Considerations

#### 1. **Concurrent Access Patterns**
- NFS supports concurrent access, but some tools may conflict
- Example: SQLite databases should use WAL mode
- Git operations should be coordinated (but generally safe)
- Build artifacts from multiple VMs may collide

#### 2. **Performance Impact**
- Network-dependent (affected by region, VM size)
- Slightly higher latency than local disk
- Caching strategies help (local .cache directories)

#### 3. **Security Implications**
- All VMs share same filesystem permissions
- User identity must be consistent (same UID/GID)
- Sensitive data accessible from all VMs
- Consider separate mounts for sensitive data

#### 4. **Best Practices**
- Use Premium storage tier for better performance
- Keep build artifacts local (e.g., `node_modules/`, `.venv/`)
- Use `.gitignore`-style exclusions for local-only data
- Implement file locking for critical operations
- Monitor storage metrics for performance tuning

- `mount_manager.py` - NFS mount configuration
- `storage_templates.py` - Pre-configured storage layouts

**Updates to existing modules**:
- `vm_provisioning.py` - Add storage configuration to cloud-init
- `config_manager.py` - Persist storage configurations
- `cost_tracker.py` - Include storage costs
- `cli.py` - Add storage command group

## Conclusion

**azlin** is a well-architected, feature-rich Azure VM management CLI that fills a unique niche in the developer tools ecosystem. Its focus on developer experience, one-command provisioning, and fleet management capabilities distinguish it from infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or general-purpose CLIs like Azure CLI.

The proposed **shared storage features** are highly feasible using Azure Files NFS and would significantly enhance azlin's value for distributed workflows, team environments, and parallel processing scenarios. Implementation is straightforward and aligns well with azlin's existing architecture.

Key strengths include modular design, comprehensive testing, and ruthless simplicity. The main opportunity for growth is expanding fleet management and coordination features while maintaining the tool's ease of use.

### Next Steps
1. Implement Azure Files NFS integration (Phase 1.1)
2. Add storage command group to CLI
3. Update documentation with shared storage examples
4. Create example workflows (ML training, CI/CD runners)
5. Benchmark performance with shared vs. local storage

**Estimated effort for Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks for core implementation, 1 week for testing and documentation.
